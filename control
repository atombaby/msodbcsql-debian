Description: anonymous Debian binary package auto-generated by debmake
 This anonymous Debian binary package was auto-generated by the
 debmake(1) command provided by the debmake package.
 .
 ===== This comes from the unmodified template file =====
 .
 Please edit this template file (debian/control) and other package files
 (debian/*) to make them meet all the requirements of the Debian Policy
 before uploading this package to the Debian archive.

 See
  * http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dreq.en.html#control

 .
 The synopsis description at the top should be about 60 characters and
 written as a phrase.  No extra capital letters or a final period.  No
 articles â€” "a", "an", or "the".
 .
 The package description for general-purpose applications should be
 written for a less technical user.  This means that we should avoid
 jargon.  GNOME or KDE is fine but GTK+ is probably not. 
 .
 Use the canonical forms of words:
  * Use X Window System, X11, or X; not X Windows, X-Windows, or X Window.
  * Use GTK+, not GTK or gtk. 
  * Use GNOME, not Gnome.
  * Use PostScript, not Postscript or postscript.
 .
 This package contains the compiled binary executable.
